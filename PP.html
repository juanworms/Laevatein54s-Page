        <h1> Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This Application is provided by Laevatein54 at no cost and is intended for use as is.
            This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my application.
            </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center">Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>I do not collect or transmit any type of data of the user, but the app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center">Third Party Services</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">Ad Mob & Personalized advertising</h3>
        <p>Google may use the advertising ID from the device on which the ad is serving to generate interests and demographics (for example, Sports enthusiasts'). Interests, demographics, and other data may used to serve better targeted ads to you.</p>
            <p> Advertising ID means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for personalized advertising. They are consistent across all mobile applications and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple, you can opt out of it by choosing “limit ad tracking” option in your privacy settings. On Google Android, you can opt out of these ads by choosing “Opt-out of personalized ads”. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
                </p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center">Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
